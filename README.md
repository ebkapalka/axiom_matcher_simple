Browser automation for Axiom Elite


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

<p align="left">Axiom Elite is a tool designed to greatly speed up the process of data entry by automating the import, pre-processing, and matching steps that would otherwise be done manually.  While this tool is very powerful, it still comes up against cases where human intervention is needed, and when you're loading 100,000 records that can take a lot of time.  This tool is designed to automate most of the manual parts of this process, fixing obviouus issues, auto-deciding obvious matches, creating new records when no close matches exist, and skipping records that still need human input.  </p>

<p align="left">The problems this tool solves could theoretically be solved by changing the matching rules and behaviour in Axiom, however that is a very arduous process and this tool is merely a quick fix until that can be done.</p>
